    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem Statement**:\n",
    "  - **Problem**: The task at hand involves predicting the stock price of Philips, a company listed on the US stock market, using Support Vector Regression (SVR).\n",
    "  - **Other Solutions and ML Model Choice**: Traditional time series forecasting methods, such as ARIMA, have been commonly employed for stock price prediction. However, SVR is chosen for its ability to capture non-linear relationships in the data and handle complex patterns. SVR is particularly suitable for predicting stock prices, as stock market data often exhibits non-linear behavior influenced by various factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Description**:\n",
    "  - **Dataset**: The dataset comprises Philips' stock price data from the US stock market. Data covers a period of ten years, from April 12, 2016, to April 12, 2016. The data is sourced from Yahoo Finance, a reliable and widely used platform for obtaining financial market data.here's the Link to the Dataset: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PHG?.tsrc=fin-srch\n",
    "  - **Variables**:\n",
    "    - Dependent Variable (Target):The closing price of Philips' stock on a given trading day. This serves as the target variable that the SVR model aims to predict.

    "## Task 1: Feature Engineering\n",
    "In this task, you are going to generate 5 features by using the package called 'pandas_ta'. Please follow the instructions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **EMA (Exponential Moving Average):**  \n",
    "   - EMA is a type of moving average that places more weight on recent close price. It's calculated based on the previous EMA value and the current close price. EMA can smooth out price data, making it easier to identify trends and potential reversal points. Using EMA as a feature in the model can capture the trend behavior.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **ATR (Average True Range):**  \n",
    "   - ATR measures market volatility by considering the trading range of an asset over a specified period. It's typically used to set stop-loss levels and to determine the size of positions. ATR provides insights into market volatility, which can help adjust risk management strategies. Higher volatility might indicate larger potential price movements, which could be useful for predicting market direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ADX (Average Directional Index):**  \n",
    "   - ADX quantifies the strength of a trend, regardless of its direction. It's derived from the smoothed averages of positive and negative directional movements. ADX helps in identifying the strength of a trend, which is valuable information for trend-following strategies. A strong trend, as indicated by a high ADX value, might imply higher confidence in trend-based predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **RSI (Relative Strength Index):**  \n",
    "   - RSI measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the market. It's expressed as a value between 0 and 100. RSI helps identify potential reversal points due to overbought or oversold conditions. Extreme RSI values might indicate a possible trend reversal, providing signals for entry or exit points in trading strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):**  \n",
    "   - MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. It consists of MACD line, signal line, and MACD histogram. MACD provides signals for trend changes and momentum shifts. Crossovers between the MACD line and signal line, as well as divergences between MACD and price, can signal potential entry or exit points in trading strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these indicators captures different aspects of market behavior, including trend direction, volatility, trend strength, and momentum. By incorporating them as features in the machine learning models, we aim to leverage these insights to improve the predictive accuracy of our models."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement:**\n",
    "- The financial world is characterized by its complexity and volatility, making accurate predictions a crucial aspect of decision-making. In this project, we aim to tackle the challenge of forecasting market behavior using machine learning techniques, focusing specifically on the application of decision tree algorithms. The primary problem we seek to address is the prediction of market trends, which involves discerning whether the market will rise or fall based on historical data and technical indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditional methods of market analysis often rely on human intuition and simplistic models, which may not capture the intricate patterns present in financial data. Machine learning (ML) models offer a promising alternative by leveraging algorithms to uncover hidden insights and make data-driven predictions. Among various ML approaches, decision tree algorithms stand out for their ability to handle complex decision-making processes and provide interpretable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The solution empowers investors and traders with valuable insights to make better decisions in financial markets. With the predictive models, users can strategically manage their investments, optimize portfolio allocations, and time their trades more effectively. For example, by leveraging analysis, traders can identify opportune moments to buy or sell stocks like Apple, potentially maximizing profits while minimizing risks. Ultimately, the model provides actionable intelligence, enabling users to navigate markets with confidence and achieve their financial goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset used in this project consists of daily market data for the Emini S&P500 index spanning over 20 years, directly downloaded from quandl. The data includes features such as opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, and trading volume. These features are recorded at regular intervals, providing a comprehensive time series dataset for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The relevant technical indicators, including Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Average True Range (ATR), Average Directional Index (ADX), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), are computed from the market data to serve as predictors for the decision tree models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The target variable for classification tasks is derived from the daily returns of the market, categorizing whether the market will rise or fall based on predefined thresholds."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "1.  The decision tree model's performance depends on the complexity of the financial market data. The model may do a good job when the features clearly separate the classes, but financial data is inherently noisy, and the relationships between features and the target are often non-linear and complex. \n",
    "The chosen features may not fully capture the underlying market behavior, which could contribute to the model's inability to make accurate predictions.\n",
    "2.  Pros and Cons\n",
    "Pros: Decision trees are easy to interpret and visualize. They can handle both numerical and categorical data and do not require feature scaling.\n",
    "Cons: Decision trees are prone to overfitting, especially when the model is too deep. Financial market data is highly volatile, and decision trees may struggle to generalize well to unseen data due to the noise present in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Overfitting Observation：The decision tree model may overfit the training data, especially if the depth is too high. This would lead to a model that performs well on training data but poorly on the test set. Particularly with highly complex or noisy datasets like financial data."

    "As seen in the evaluation results, the deep decision tree achieved an accuracy of around 50.76% on the test set, which indicates poor generalization. The confusion matrix shows that the model struggles to differentiate between the two classes, with a high number of misclassifications for both positive and negative cases. The classification report also reflects the model's poor performance, with precision, recall, and F1-scores around 0.51, indicating that the model is not effectively learning generalizable patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting occurs because the model captures not only the underlying patterns but also the noise in the training data, leading to poor generalization to unseen data. The deep decision tree is likely to have a high training accuracy but performs poorly on the test set, as it fails to generalize well to new, unseen data. "

    "### Discussion on Random Forest Performance\n",
    "Compared to the deep decision tree, the Random Forest model is less prone to overfitting because it aggregates the results from multiple decision trees, each trained on different subsets of the data. As seen in the evaluation results, the Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of around 51.09%, which is slightly better than the deep decision tree's accuracy of 50.76%. The confusion matrix shows that the Random Forest model reduces the number of misclassifications compared to the deep decision tree, particularly for class 1. The classification report indicates slightly better recall and F1-score for class 1, suggesting that the Random Forest model is better at identifying the positive class."

    "As observed in the plot, the accuracy initially increases with the number of trees, reaching a peak at around 400 trees, with an accuracy slightly above 52%. Beyond this point, the accuracy declines when the number of trees reaches 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "This trend suggests that while increasing the number of trees generally helps improve accuracy by reducing variance and enhancing generalization, there is a point where the model may become overly complex, leading to diminished returns or even a slight reduction in accuracy. The slight decline at 500 trees could be due to overfitting or the increased difficulty in averaging a large number of models, which might start capturing noise rather than useful patterns. "
